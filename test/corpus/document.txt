			This paragraph has an ID, two classes, and two additional
			attributes.  GSP allows us to use the ‘#ident’ and ‘.ident’
			syntaxes as shorthands for applying IDs, and classes.  This
			is a text node, so nothing is being interpreted as GSP nodes,
			but we can include them inline if we want.  As an example,
			here is some @em {-emphatic} text.  Your inline nodes can
			also have attributes @em #id {-just like a regular node}.
